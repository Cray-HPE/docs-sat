# Introduction to SAT

## About System Admin Toolkit (SAT)

The System Admin Toolkit (SAT) is designed to assist administrators with common tasks, such as troubleshooting and
querying information about the HPE Cray EX System and its components, system boot and shutdown, and replacing hardware
components.

SAT offers a command line utility which uses subcommands. There are similarities between SAT commands and `xt` commands
used on the Cray XC platform. For more information on SAT commands, see [SAT Command Overview](#sat-command-overview).

Six Kibana Dashboards are included with SAT. They provide organized output for system health information.

- [AER Kibana Dashboard](dashboards/SAT_Kibana_Dashboards.md#aer-kibana-dashboard)
- [ATOM Kibana Dashboard](dashboards/SAT_Kibana_Dashboards.md#atom-kibana-dashboard)
- [Heartbeat Kibana Dashboard](dashboards/SAT_Kibana_Dashboards.md#heartbeat-kibana-dashboard)
- [Kernel Kibana Dashboard](dashboards/SAT_Kibana_Dashboards.md#kernel-kibana-dashboard)
- [MCE Kibana Dashboard](dashboards/SAT_Kibana_Dashboards.md#mce-kibana-dashboard)
- [RAS Daemon Kibana Dashboard](dashboards/SAT_Kibana_Dashboards.md#ras-daemon-kibana-dashboard)

Four Grafana Dashboards are included with SAT. They display messages that are generated by the HSN (High Speed Network) and
are reported through Redfish.

- [Grafana Fabric Congestion Dashboard](dashboards/SAT_Grafana_Dashboards.md#grafana-fabric-congestion-dashboard)
- [Grafana Fabric Errors Dashboard](dashboards/SAT_Grafana_Dashboards.md#grafana-fabric-errors-dashboard)
- [Grafana Fabric Port State Dashboard](dashboards/SAT_Grafana_Dashboards.md#grafana-fabric-port-state-dashboard)
- [Grafana Fabric RFC3635 Dashboard](dashboards/SAT_Grafana_Dashboards.md#grafana-fabric-rfc3635-dashboard)

In CSM 1.3 and newer, the `sat` command is automatically available on all the
Kubernetes NCNs. For more information, see [SAT in CSM](#sat-in-csm). Older
versions of CSM do not have the `sat` command automatically available, and SAT
must be installed as a separate product.

## SAT Command Overview

Describes the SAT Command Line Utility, lists the key commands found in the System Admin Toolkit man pages, and provides
instruction on the SAT Container Environment.

### SAT Command Line Utility

The primary component of the System Admin Toolkit (SAT) is a command-line utility run from Kubernetes manager nodes
(`ncn-m` nodes).

It is designed to assist administrators with common tasks, such as troubleshooting and querying information about the
HPE Cray EX System and its components, system boot and shutdown, and replacing hardware components. There are
similarities between SAT commands and `xt` commands used on the Cray XC platform.

### SAT Commands

The top-level SAT man page describes the toolkit, documents the global options affecting all subcommands, documents
configuration file options, and references the man page for each subcommand. SAT consists of many subcommands that each
have their own set of options.

### SAT Container Environment

The `sat` command-line utility runs in a container using Podman, a daemonless container runtime. SAT runs on
Kubernetes manager nodes. A few important points about the SAT container environment include the following:

- Using either `sat` or `sat bash` always launches a container.
- The SAT container does not have access to the NCN file system.

There are two ways to run sat.

- **Interactive**: Launching a container using `sat bash`, followed by a `sat` command.
- **Non-interactive**: Running a `sat` command directly on a Kubernetes manager node.

In both of these cases, a container is launched in the background to execute the command. The first option, running
`sat bash` first, gives an interactive shell, at which point `sat` commands can be run. In the second option, the
container is launched, executes the command, and upon the command's completion the container exits. The following two
examples show the same action, checking the system status, using interactive and non-interactive modes.

#### Interactive

```screen
ncn-m001# sat bash
(CONTAINER-ID)sat-container# sat status
```

#### Non-interactive

```screen
ncn-m001# sat status
```

#### Interactive Advantages

Running `sat` using the interactive command prompt gives the ability to read and write local files on ephemeral
container storage. If multiple `sat` commands are being run in succession, then use sat bash to launch the
container beforehand. This will save time because the container does not need to be launched for each `sat` command.

#### Non-interactive Advantages

The non-interactive mode is useful if calling `sat` with a script, or when running a single `sat` command as a part of
several steps that need to be executed from a management NCN.

#### Man Pages - Interactive and Non-interactive Modes

To view a `sat` man page from a Kubernetes manager node, use `sat-man` on the manager node as shown in the following
example.

```screen
ncn-m001# sat-man status
```

A man page describing the SAT container environment is available on the Kubernetes manager nodes, which can be viewed
either with `man sat` or man `sat-podman` from the manager node.

```screen
ncn-m001# man sat
```

```screen
ncn-m001# man sat-podman
```

## Command Prompt Conventions in SAT

The host name in a command prompt indicates where the command must be run. The account that must run the command is
also indicated in the prompt.

- The `root` or super-user account always has the `#` character at the end of the prompt and has the host name of the
  host in the prompt.
- Any non-`root` account is indicated with account@hostname>. A user account that is neither `root` nor `crayadm` is
  referred to as `user`.
- The command prompt inside the SAT container environment is indicated with the string as follows. It also has the "#"
  character at the end of the prompt.

| Command Prompt | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| `ncn-m001#` | Run on one of the Kubernetes Manager servers. (**Non-interactive**) |
| `(CONTAINER_ID) sat-container#` | Run the command inside the SAT container environment by first running `sat bash`. (**Interactive**) |

Examples of the `sat status` command used by an administrator:

```screen
ncn-m001# sat status
```

```screen
ncn-m001# sat bash
(CONTAINER_ID) sat-container# sat status
```

## SAT in CSM

In CSM 1.3 and newer, the `sat` command is automatically available on all the Kubernetes NCNs, but it is still possible
to install SAT as a separate product stream. Any version of SAT installed as a separate product stream overrides the
`sat` command available in CSM. Installing the SAT product stream allows additional supporting components to be added:

- An entry for SAT in the `cray-product-catalog` Kubernetes ConfigMap is only created by installing the SAT product
  stream. Otherwise, there will be no entry for this version of SAT in the output of `sat showrev`.

- The `sat-install-utility` container image is only available with the full SAT product stream. This container image
  provides uninstall and activate functionality when used with the `prodmgr` command. (In SAT 2.3 and older, SAT was
  only available to install as a separate product stream. Because these versions were packaged with
  `sat-install-utility`, it is still possible to uninstall these versions of SAT.)

- The `docs-sat` RPM package is only available with the full SAT product stream.

- The `sat-config-management` git repository in Gitea (VCS) and thus the SAT layer of NCN CFS configuration is
  only available with the full SAT product stream.

If the SAT product stream is not installed, there will be no configuration content for SAT in VCS. Therefore, CFS
configurations that apply to management NCNs (for example, `management-23.05`) should not include a SAT layer.

The SAT configuration layer modifies the permissions of files left over from prior installations of SAT, so that the
Keycloak username that authenticates to the API gateway cannot be read by users other than `root`. Specifically, it
it does the following:

- Modifies the `sat.toml` configuration file which contains the username so that it is only readable by `root`.

- Modifies the `/root/.config/sat/tokens` directory so that the directory is only readable by `root`. This is needed
  because the names of the files within the `tokens` directory contain the username.

Regardless of the SAT configuration being applied, passwords and the contents of the tokens are never readable by other
users. These permission changes only apply to files created by previous installations of SAT. In the current version of
SAT all files and directories are created with the appropriate permissions.
