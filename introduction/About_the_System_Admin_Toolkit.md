# About System Admin Toolkit (SAT)

The System Admin Toolkit \(SAT\) is designed to assist administrators with common tasks, such as troubleshooting and
querying information about the HPE Cray EX System and its components, system boot and shutdown, and replacing hardware
components.

SAT offers a command line utility which uses subcommands. There are similarities between SAT commands and xt commands
used on the Cray XC platform. For more information on SAT commands, see [System Admin Toolkit Command Overview](#system-admin-toolkit-command-overview).

Six Kibana Dashboards are included with SAT. They provide organized output for system health information.

- [Kernel Kibana Dashboard](#kernel-kibana-dashboard)
- [MCE Kibana Dashboard](#mce-kibana-dashboard)

Four Grafana Dashboards are included with SAT. They display messages that are generated by the HSN (High Speed Network) and
are reported through Redfish.

- [Grafana Fabric Congestion Dashboard](#grafana-fabric-congestion-dashboard)
- [Grafana Fabric Errors Dashboard](#grafana-fabric-errors-dashboard)
- [Grafana Fabric Port State Dashboard](#grafana-fabric-port-state-dashboard)
