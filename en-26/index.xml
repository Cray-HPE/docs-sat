      <description>Change the BOS Version By default, SAT uses Boot Orchestration Service (BOS) version two (v2). Select the BOS version to use for individual commands with the --bos-version option. For more information on this option, refer to the man page for a specific command.&#xA;Another way to change the BOS version is by configuring it under the api_version setting in the bos section of the SAT configuration file. If the system is using an existing SAT configuration file from an older version of SAT, the bos section might not exist.</description>

      <description>SAT Command Authentication Some SAT subcommands make requests to the HPE Cray EX services through the API gateway and thus require authentication to the API gateway in order to function. Other SAT subcommands use the Kubernetes API. Some sat commands require S3 to be configured. In order to use the SAT S3 bucket, the System Administrator must generate the S3 access key and secret keys and write them to a local file.</description>

      <description>Introduction to SAT About System Admin Toolkit (SAT) The System Admin Toolkit (SAT) is designed to assist administrators with common tasks, such as troubleshooting and querying information about the HPE Cray EX System and its components, system boot and shutdown, and replacing hardware components.&#xA;SAT offers a command line utility which uses subcommands. There are similarities between SAT commands and xt commands used on the Cray XC platform. For more information on SAT commands, see SAT Command Overview.</description>

      <description>SAT Bootprep SAT provides an automated solution for creating CFS configurations, building and configuring images in IMS, and creating BOS session templates. The solution is based on a given input file that defines how those configurations, images, and session templates should be created. This automated process centers around the sat bootprep command. Man page documentation for sat bootprep can be viewed similar to other SAT commands.&#xA;(ncn-m001#) Here is an example:</description>

      <description>SAT in CSM In CSM 1.3 and newer, the sat command is automatically available on the Kubernetes control plane, but it is still possible to install SAT as a separate product stream. Any version of SAT installed as a separate product stream overrides the sat command available in CSM. Installing the SAT product stream allows additional supporting components to be added:&#xA;An entry for SAT in the cray-product-catalog Kubernetes ConfigMap is only created by installing the SAT product stream.</description>

      <description>SAT on an External System SAT can optionally be installed and configured on an external system to interact with CSM over the CAN.&#xA;Limitations Most SAT subcommands work by accessing APIs which are reachable via the CAN. However, certain SAT commands depend on host-based functionality on the management NCNs and will not work from an external system. This includes the following:&#xA;The platform-services and ncn-power stages of sat bootsys The local host information displayed by the --local option of sat showrev Installing SAT on an external system is not an officially supported configuration.</description>
