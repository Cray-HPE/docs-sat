# Contribution Requirements

If you would like to contribute to this project, please open a pull request.

Contributors must follow the guidelines below:

- Contributions must follow the [style
   guide](./portal/developer-portal/pubs/writing-style.md).
- When making commits, use the ``--signoff``/``-s`` option to ``git commit``. By
   doing so, you are certifying that you have the rights to submit this work
   under the same license used by this project and agree to the
   [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org).
- Include detailed commit messages that start with a short subject line,
   followed by a blank line, followed by a longer description that documents
   what the commit changes and why. For guidance, see [How to Write a Git
   Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- Organize commits into cohesive, functional units, such that each commit
   contains comprehensive, self-contained documentation, and the text makes
   sense as a whole at each point in the commit history. I.e., don't include
   multiple commits where the first commit is an incomplete bit of
   documentation, and the following commits complete the text.
- Address feedback received in the pull request as additional commits. Then
   once approval is attained, squash bugfixes and feedback commits into the
   original commit(s) as appropriate per guideline #4 above. The reason for the
   separate commits addressing feedback is that it provides an easy way for
   reviewers to see only what changed if desired.
- Pull requests should, at a minimum, contain a summary of the proposed changes
   in their descriptions. For many small changes with a single commit, simply
   copying the commit message is likely sufficient. For larger changes or new
   features, it may be appropriate to elaborate on the proposed changes, and
   possibly provide rationale or design documentation.
