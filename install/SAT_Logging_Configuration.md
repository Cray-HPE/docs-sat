# SAT Logging

As of SAT version 2.2, some command output that was previously printed to `stdout`
is now logged to `stderr`. These messages are logged at the `INFO` level. The
default logging threshold was changed from `WARNING` to `INFO` to accomodate
this logging change. Additionally, some messages previously logged at the `INFO`
are now logged at the `DEBUG` level.

These changes take effect automatically. However, if the default output threshold
has been manually set in `~/.config/sat/sat.toml`, it should be changed to ensure
that important output is shown in the terminal.

## Update Configuration

In the following example, the stderr log level, `logging.stderr_level`, is set to
`WARNING`, which will exclude `INFO`-level logging from terminal output.

```screen
ncn-m001:~ # grep -A 3 logging ~/.config/sat/sat.toml
[logging]
...
stderr_level = "WARNING"
```

To enable the new default behavior, comment this line out, delete it, or set
the value to "INFO".

If `logging.stderr_level` is commented out, its value will not affect logging
behavior. However, it may be helpful set its value to `INFO` as a reminder of
the new default behavior.

## Affected Commands

The following commands trigger messages that have been changed from `stdout`
print calls to `INFO`-level (or `WARNING`- or `ERROR`-level) log messages:

```
sat bootsys --stage shutdown --stage session-checks
sat sensors
```

The following commands trigger messages that have been changed from `INFO`-level
log messages to `DEBUG`-level log messages:

```
sat nid2xname
sat xname2nid
sat swap
```
