# HPE Writing Style Guide

Sourced from: [Style Guide - Original](https://h10014.www1.hpe.com/brand-central/content/writing-style)

Condensed and converted to markdown for usage in GIT repositories in a "docs as code" paradigm.  

# Introduction
The Writing Style Guide (WSG) contains writing style standards for team members and partners of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The WSG provides rules and conventions to be used in all HPE writing, with the following goals:

* Consistent terminology and usage
* Easier repurposing of content
* Accurate translation at a lower cost

Only basic formatting suggestions are included and are not intended to replace group-specific guidelines. Use your group-specific template or guidelines when available.

# Writing tips

Good writing is clear, direct, informative, and as simple as possible. 

* **Be clear**. Write simply what you need to communicate. If a sentence becomes long and confusing, divide it to make shorter and clearer ones, or use a list.

* **Be concise**. Write only what you need to communicate. Remove unnecessary words from your sentences and unnecessary sentences from your paragraphs. Do not use two or three words where one will suffice.

   - Concise: You need three tools for this procedure.
   - Wordy: There are three tools that you will need in order to perform this procedure.
   
* **Be consistent**. Inconsistencies in style, format, and use of terms are usually obvious to the reader and are often confusing. Inconsistencies can create doubt over the accuracy of the information and can result in the loss of credibility.

* **Use specific, definite language**. Write exactly what you need to communicate. Choose precise words over vague ones and include the details that matter.

   - Specific: You might lose your data if you do not back up your hard drive.
   - Vague: A major problem might result if you fail to take precautionary measures.

* **Use the active voice**. For proper emphasis on what a sentence is about, use the active voice primarily. The active voice is concise and direct. It places emphasis on the subject performing the action. The passive voice is wordy and indirect. It places emphasis on the object receiving the action.
  
   - Active: Select Close to complete the operation.
   - Passive: The operation will be completed when you select Close.
   
* **Put statements in positive form**. Negative statements are comparable to using the passive voice. Positive statements are comparable to using the active voice. To create positive statements, remove the word not from your sentences when possible.

   - Positive: She ignored the warning.
   - Negative: She did not pay any attention to the warning.

* **Use parallel structure**. Elements that are alike in function should be alike in construction. For clarity and flow, use parallel structure (the same grammatical form) in headings and lists. The items in the following example are all sentence fragments beginning with an adverb. For example:

  In this issue, you’ll learn about:

  * What’s changing
  * How to get prepared
  * Where you can find more information
  
* **Structure sentences with subordination**. Subordinate the less important idea to the main idea in a sentence. This structure can help the reader understand what information is more important.

   * Instead of: The system is a high-performance system and has eight processors.
  * Write: The high-performance system has eight processors.

* **Structure paragraphs with unity**. For unity and coherence, a paragraph should deal with a single topic. The sentences should tie together and contribute directly to the subject of the paragraph.

# Style, grammar, and punctuation guidelines

## 24x7, 24/7
Use a lowercase x or a slash without spaces. Do not use 24 by 7.

## Abbreviations
An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase that replaces the word or phrase. Use only common, accepted abbreviations. Do not create your own abbreviations just to keep from repeating long words or phrases.

Common abbreviations are acceptable in examples, graphics, footnotes, and tables, particularly when space is limited.

Do not begin a sentence with an abbreviation.

### Common abbreviations

* Approximately - Approx.
* Company - Co.
* Corporation - Corp.
* Department - Dept.
* Incorporated - Inc.
* Management - Mgmt.
* Manufacturing - Mfg.
* Miscellaneous - Misc.
* Revision or revised - Rev.

## Plurals of abbreviations
Plural forms of common abbreviations include the following:

• Month: mo. (singular), mos. (plural)
• Number: no. (singular), nos. (plural)
• Page: p. (singular), pp. (plural)

## Ability, capability, capacity
Ability refers to a person’s skill or talent. Capability refers to an ability or potential ability of a person or thing. Capacity is the ability to contain something, or an amount that can be contained. (It can also mean duty or role.)

Examples: 

Her ability to come up with creative solutions is impressive.
The new version of the system adds many capabilities.
A person’s capacity for learning is limitless.

## Above, below
Avoid using above or below when referring to other content. Use specific cross-references whenever possible  If you can’t make specific cross-references, use previous and following rather than above and below.


## Absolute terms
Question the use of absolute terms, such as all, never, and none. In certain instances, their use is valid. However, the use of these terms is inappropriate when even one possible exception exists.

## Accept, except
Accept means to receive or agree with. Except means to exclude.

## Acronyms
An acronym is a word formed from the initial letter or letters of each word or major word in a compound term. The word acronym is also used for an abbreviation formed with initial letters, that is, an initialism.

Use only approved, legitimate acronyms. Do not create your own just to keep from repeating long phrases. Avoid overusing acronyms.
Do not define an acronym in a title, heading, or caption. On the first use of the acronym in body text, write out the full term, followed by the acronym in parentheses. Then use the acronym on subsequent references.

In a long document, you might choose to occasionally redefine an acronym to aid comprehension, for example, at the beginning of a new section or subsection.
If your content has a glossary, include all acronyms in the glossary. Some authoring systems link from the acronym to the definition in the glossary, in which case the definition is not needed in the body text.

### Exceptions to defining acronyms

It’s unnecessary to define acronyms that are well known to the target audience. For example, you likely wouldn’t define FTE when writing to HR professionals or IRS when writing to a US audience. In such cases, the context is ample to identify the acronym.

See Appendix A for a list of technical acronyms that don’t require definition for most technical audiences. Some of these acronyms don’t require definition for any audience, such as DVD.

For an internal audience, consider whether an acronym might be unknown to new HPE team members.
In all cases, carefully consider your target audience when deciding whether to define an acronym.
“A” and “an” with acronyms
Use “a” before an acronym that’s read as a word and begins with a consonant sound.

Example: A SWOT analysis

Use “an” before an acronym that’s read as individual letters and begins with a vowel sound.

Example: An MBA in leadership

### Capitalization of acronyms

In general, use uppercase for acronyms.

Examples: ASCII, POST, RAM

The exceptions are acronyms in which the accepted usage combines uppercase and lowercase.
Examples: iLO (integrated Lights Out), iSCSI (integrated Small Computer System Interface)

If the definition for an acronym is a proper noun, use title case (initial caps) for the definition.
Example: When you power on the computer, the system runs the Power-On Self-Test (POST).
If the definition for an acronym is not a proper noun, use lowercase for the definition.
Example: Use your personal identification number (PIN) to access your account.
Use the same case for acronyms regardless of where they appear.

### Plural and possessive forms of acronyms

Form the plural of an acronym by adding a lowercase s.
Examples: DIMMs, WANs, DVDs, MP3s
Use an apostrophe with an acronym only to create the possessive form.
Examples: the CEO’s agenda, the IRS’s policy
If you define an acronym in its plural form, don’t redefine it when using the singular form.
Example: Subject matter experts (SMEs) are members of the project team. Each SME will be assigned specific content areas to review.

## Addresses

In body text, spell out suffixes for street names, even those commonly used.

Example: We have facilities at 321 Main Street and 514 Mills Road.

Street name suffixes may be abbreviated in tables, a list of addresses, and informal communications.

Examples: 321 Main St., 514 Mills Rd., 58 Grand Ave., 24 Green Blvd., 1967 Penny Ln.

NOTE: For US addresses, you may use both a post office box number and a street address. However, mail will be delivered to the address line immediately above the city and state.


## Adjectives

Avoid long strings of adjectives, which might lead to misinterpretation or be difficult to follow. As a general rule, use a maximum of three adjectives before a noun.

* Instead of: This includes our first-of-its-kind science-based supply chain management program.
* Write: This includes our supply chain management program, the first of its kind based on science.

See also: Comma, coordinate adjectives; Comma, cumulative adjectives; Hyphen

### Using adjectives as verbs

Avoid using adjectives as verbs, such as “gifted” to mean “gave.”

## Advice, advise

Advice is a noun. Advise is a verb meaning to give advice to. It also means to inform.

## Affect, effect

Affect is commonly a verb, and effect is commonly a noun. When you affect (influence) something, it produces an effect (a result).

Example

* The news might affect the team’s morale.
* The news had an effect on the team’s morale.

In the less common verb form, effect means “to bring about.”

Example: News can effect change by inspiring people to act.

## Alert text

The guidelines in this section comply with ANSI Z535.6-2011, Product Safety Information in Product Manuals, Instructions, and Other Collateral Materials.
Alert text appears outside a normal paragraph for emphasis. Each type of alert has a specific use:

• DANGER—Indicates a hazardous situation that, if not avoided, will result in death or serious injury. This text is to be limited to the most extreme situations. Call out the hazard, injury, and steps to avoid it.
• WARNING—Indicates a hazardous situation that, if not avoided, could result in death or serious injury. Call out the hazard or consequence and how to avoid it.
• CAUTION—Indicates a hazardous situation that, if not avoided, could result in minor or moderate injury. Call out the hazard or consequence and steps to avoid it.
• NOTICE—Indicates information considered important but not hazard-related (for example, messages related to property damage). A notice alerts the user that failure to follow a procedure exactly as described could result in loss of data or in damage to hardware or software.
• IMPORTANT—Provides essential information to explain a concept or to complete a task.
• NOTE—Contains additional information to emphasize or supplement important points of the main text. Information in a note should not add value to the preceding text; if it does, use an important alert instead.
• TIP—Provides helpful hints for completing a task. Do not use a tip to give essential information. A tip might provide an alternative method for completing the task that precedes it.

When writing alert text, be direct and brief. Use the instructional second person (the understood you construction), active voice, and present tense whenever possible.

When writing danger, warning, and caution alerts, clearly state the nature of the hazard, the consequences of not avoiding the hazard, and the method for avoiding the hazard.

### Alert placement

Put danger, warning, caution, and notice alerts before the procedural step that involves the potential for bodily harm or equipment damage. This reduces the chance that the user will perform the step without realizing the possible consequence. Other types of alerts can appear before or after the related text, depending on the context.
Avoid information overload. If alerts include too many items and sections contain too many alerts, look at reorganizing your information.
If more than one alert is included in the same place, position the alerts in the following order:

1. DANGER
2. WARNING
3. CAUTION
4. NOTICE
5. IMPORTANT
6. NOTE or TIP

### Alert style and symbol

Alerts can be flush left with the text margin or indented. The heading (signal word) for the alert appears in uppercase bold followed by a colon, except for the danger alert, which is followed by an exclamation point. Use sentence case for text that follows the heading. Do not bold this text.
For the danger, warning, and caution symbol, use the warning icon from the Technical Icons collection (see Iconography on Brand Central). Do not use this icon with notice alerts that indicate the possibility of equipment damage or data loss. Using an icon for other alerts is optional.
You can place the symbol inside or outside the rule. For a danger alert, consider using a larger text size for the heading.
Examples

DANGER! Electric shock hazard. Do not touch terminals. Terminals on both the line and load sides might be energized in the open position.
WARNING: Open gears and mechanical parts can trap hands, fingers, and clothing, and cause serious injury. Stay clear of open gears and mechanical parts.
CAUTION: Sharp edges are exposed when replacing the part. Avoid sharp edges and use care when replacing.
NOTICE: To prevent a server malfunction or equipment damage, do not add or remove the battery pack while an array capacity expansion is in progress.

## All, all of

Use all with a common noun and all of with a personal pronoun.
Example
All the settings have defaults.
All of his files are listed in the directory.

## Alphabetization

To list items in alphabetical order, use the automatic sort feature of your application. When alphabetizing manually, use the word-by-word method.
Example:

```
Logging in
Log on
Log out
For comparison, when you use the letter-by-letter method, you get:
Log on
Log out
Logging in
```

Alphabetize acronyms and abbreviations according to their shortened form, not as they would appear in the list if spelled out.

When a continuous list is in a table, alphabetize the items vertically from one column to the next.
Example:
```
Adjectives
Conjunctions
Prepositions
Adverbs
Interjections
Pronouns
Articles
Nouns
Verbs
```

When alphabetizing a list of mixed information types, use this order:

1. Special characters (symbols), without spelling them out
2. Numerals, in ascending order
3. Words, in alphabetical order


## Among, between
Use between when writing about distinct, separate items. Use among when writing in generalities about collective groups.

Examples:

```
The table lists the differences between rack, tower, and blade servers.
The servers are among the highest rated in the industry.
Major differences exist between English, Arabic, Mandarin, and Polish.
She could choose only one language class from among the dozens offered.

## Amount, number

Use amount to reference items that are not ordinarily counted.

Example: The amount of information was staggering.

Use number to refer to items that are usually counted.

Example: The number of attendees was surprising.

## Ampersand (&)
Use an ampersand for the word and in these instances:

* Proper nouns that use an ampersand, such as trademarked names, program names, and organization names
* Internal org names at HPE
* Job titles, for example, VP & General Manager
* Where space is extremely limited, such as a graphic label

## And/or

Avoid using and/or in a sentence. It is preferable—unless the result is cumbersome—to rewrite the sentence or to use the two choices followed by or both.

* Correct: Use a file specification, logical name, or both.
* Less correct: Use a file specification and/or logical name.

In tables and graphics, use and/or if needed to conserve space.

## Angle brackets (< >)

Use the term angle brackets to refer to the symbols < >. When referring to the individual angle brackets, 
use the terms left angle bracket (<) and right angle bracket (>).

Use the > and < symbols in tables to indicate greater than and less than. Always put a space between the angle bracket and the value. 
In body text, write out less than and greater than.

In discussions of XML programming, these symbols are often referred to as opening and closing triangular brackets.

For bit notation in technical reference guides, use angle brackets to enclose bit values and bit fields.

Examples: < 7 >, < 15..12 >

You can use the right angle bracket (>) when writing a system prompt (C:>).

Avoid using the right angle bracket (>) in command sequences. Instead, consider using the Symbol font right arrow symbol (→).

See also: Greater than (>); Less than (<); Arrow symbol

## Anthropomorphization, personification

Do not attribute personal qualities to inanimate objects. For example, computers do not think, believe, assume, or let.

* Correct: After 30 minutes of inactivity, the system logs you out.
* Incorrect: After 30 minutes of inactivity, the system assumes you are finished and logs you out.

## Any more, anymore

Use any more as an adjective phrase meaning “any additional.”

Example: We don’t need any more meetings.

Use anymore as an adverb meaning “any longer.”

Example: We don’t need this meeting anymore.

## Any one, anyone

Use any one to refer to a single thing or person.

Example: Can any one of the team members lead the meeting?

Use anyone as a general reference.

Example: Does anyone know when the next meeting will be?

## Apostrophes

Apostrophes, Hewlett Packard Enterprise name

See: Hewlett Packard Enterprise name

### Apostrophes, possessive case

To form the possessive of singular and plural nouns not ending in the letter s, add an s with an apostrophe.

Examples: the manager’s policy, one writer’s opinion, the women’s conference

To form the possessive of singular nouns ending in s, add an apostrophe and an s.

Example: the stylus’s design

To form the possessive of plural nouns ending in s, add only an apostrophe.

Examples: two writers’ opinions, the Joneses’ house

To show joint possession, add an apostrophe (with or without an s, according to the preceding rules) to the last element of a compound subject.

Example: Joe and Jane’s meeting space

To show individual possession of nouns, make both nouns possessive.

Example: Joe’s and Jane’s perspectives

### Apostrophes, possessive case of indefinite pronouns

To form the possessive of indefinite pronouns, add an apostrophe and the letter s.

Examples: someone’s book, anyone’s guess, no one’s wish, everyone’s duty

Do not use an apostrophe to form the possessive form of personal, relative, and interrogative pronouns.

Examples: its, his, theirs, mine, ours, whose, hers, your, yours

### Apostrophes, product names

Do not use an apostrophe to form the possessive of a product, program, or service name.

* Correct: The HPE ProLiant DL560 Gen9 server is ideal for virtualization and server consolidation.
* Incorrect: HPE’s ProLiant DL560 Gen9 server is ideal for virtualization and server consolidation.

## Appears

The word appears is an intransitive verb and does not require an object. Use appears to describe a window or dialog box opening.

* Correct: When the process ends, a message appears.
* Incorrect: When the process ends, a message displays.

The word displays is a transitive verb and requires an object.

See also: Displays

## Appendix, appendixes

Use the plural appendixes, not appendices.
See also: Appendixes

## Arrow symbol

To indicate a succession of commands, consider using the Symbol font arrow (→), character code 174, with a space before and after the arrow. It is also acceptable to use words for a succession of commands.

Examples

* Click Start → Control Panel → Device Manager.
* Click Start, then Control Panel, and then Device Manager.

## Articles (a, an, the)

Include articles in complete sentences and sentence fragments, regardless of where the text appears. Most languages emphasize articles more than English does. Articles help to distinguish between nouns and verbs.

* Correct: Insert a space before the symbol.
* Incorrect: Insert space before symbol

Avoid using articles at the beginning of titles, headings, lists, and graphic captions.

* Correct: Minimum system requirements
* Incorrect: The minimum system requirements

Use the article a before a word that begins with a consonant sound. Use an before a word that begins with a vowel sound, including words that begin with the sounds ef, el, em, en, ar, es, uh, oo, and eks.

Examples: a closed window, an active window

Use the article a before an acronym that is read as a word and begins with a consonant sound. Use an before an acronym that is read as individual letters and begins with a vowel sound.

Examples: a SAN solution, an SD-WAN leader

## As, like

The conjunction as means “in the same way that.” The preposition like means “similar to." Use as if what follows includes a verb. Use like if what follows is a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase.

Examples:

* She, as all good writers do, uses proper grammar in emails. (verb)
* She, like all good writers, uses proper grammar in emails. (noun)

Do not use the word as to be a synonym for the conjunctions because and while.

* Correct: Because this social media group is inactive, it will be deleted.
* Incorrect: As this social media group is inactive, it will be deleted.
* Correct: While the virus scan runs, you can continue working.
* Incorrect: As the virus scan runs, you can continue working.

## As a service

When writing as-a-service terms in a sentence, use lowercase for “service” and “everything.”

Examples:

* Deliver an offering as a service
* Offering everything as a service

In abbreviations, represent “service” and “everything” with an initial cap.

Examples: aaS, EaaS

Use hyphens only when an aaS term is used as an adjective before a noun.

Examples:

* An as-a-service offering
* The everything-as-a-service model

For more details and examples, see Writing Style on Brand Central.

## Assure, ensure, insure

See: Ensure, insure, assure

## Asterisk placement
In a sentence, an asterisk (*) used as a reference mark is placed before an em dash, but after all other punctuation marks.

## Backup, back up

Use backup as a noun or adjective.

Examples:

* Use the backup to replicate data after failure. (noun)
* Use the backup CD to restore the database server. (adjective)
* Use back up as a verb.

Example: Back up your data now. (verb)

## Because of, due to, since

Use because of as a preposition to indicate cause.

Example: The system is fast because of its disk caching capability.

Due to means caused by or resulting from. Use due to only after a form of the verb to be.

Example: The system problems are due to a network issue.

The word since can refer to either time or cause. For clarity, use since to indicate time and because to indicate cause.

Examples:

* The interface hasn’t changed much since 2014.
* The interface should be familiar because it hasn’t changed much.

## Bit notation

Use angle brackets to enclose bit values and bit fields.

Examples: < 7 >, < 15..12 >

## Bold

See: Emphasis

## Boot, reboot

When writing for a technical audience, use boot and reboot. When writing for a nontechnical audience, use start and restart.

## Braces ({ })

Use the term braces, not curly braces, to refer to these symbols: { }. When referring to individual braces, use the terms left brace ({) and right brace (}).

In syntax diagrams using brackets and braces, braces indicate that at least one of the enclosed elements is required.

## Brackets ([ ])

Use the term brackets, not square brackets, to refer to these symbols: [ ]. When referring to the individual brackets, use the terms left bracket ([) and right bracket (]).

In syntax diagrams using brackets and braces, brackets indicate that all the enclosed elements are optional.

In body text, avoid constructions that require the use of brackets. Parenthetical information should be enclosed in parentheses.
If, however, a parenthetical statement is embedded within a parenthetical statement, use parentheses for the outer set of marks and brackets for the inner set of marks.

Example: Press the Standby button. (This feature shuts off subsystems that have been idle for more than 10 minutes [the default setting]).

Follow the same punctuation rules for brackets as for parentheses.

If brackets enclose a sentence, place the period inside the right bracket.
If brackets enclose a phrase that ends a sentence, place the period outside the right bracket.

See also: Angle brackets (< >); Parentheses

## Bulleted lists

See: Unordered (bulleted) lists

## Buttons and switches

When referring to buttons on a pointing device, use the term mouse buttons to differentiate from on-screen control buttons.
In a simple user interface, do not refer to a button on the screen by name (for example, click the OK button). 
Instead, refer to the label (for example, click OK). However, in complex user interfaces with many different types of targets, 
include the class of the object.

Use lowercase letters for buttons that are not labeled on the screen (for example, the minimize button).
When referring to hardware:

* Specify the type of button, such as an on/off switch or a mouse button.
* Refer to a key on the keyboard as a key, not as a button.
* Refer to a button on the front panel as a button.

## By using, with

Avoid using the word with to mean “by using.” It is ambiguous and makes translation more difficult.

* Instead of: Select part of the picture with the dotted rectangle selection tool.
* Write: Select part of the picture by using the dotted rectangle selection tool.

## Can, may, might

Use can to mean ability, may to mean permission, and might to mean possibility.
See also: Word choice

## Capitalization

Case refers to capitalization style. Commonly used terminology includes the following:

### Title Case (also known as initial caps)
The first letter of each word is capitalized except the following words unless they are the first or last word in a title:

− Articles: a, an, the
− Short conjunctions: and, as, but, if, or, nor
− Short prepositions: at, by, for, in, of, off, on, out, to, up

### Sentence case
The first letter of the first word is capitalized, and the first letter of proper nouns are capitalized.

* UPPERCASE—All letters are capitalized.
* lowercase—All letters are lowercase.
* CamelCase—The first letter of each word or abbreviation in a closed compound is capitalized (for example, DreamColor). In some instances, the first letter is lowercase (for example, iTunes).

## Capitalizing alert titles and text

See: Alert style and symbol

### Capitalizing commands

In the case of command lines, confirm whether the command parser is case sensitive. For case-sensitive parsers, match the case of the command; for case-insensitive parsers, use lowercase.

### Capitalizing cross-references to documents and sections

When referring to a document by its complete title, retain the case. Use lowercase for generic references to documents.

Example:

* See the HPE Sizer for Microsoft Lync Server User Guide. (complete title)
* See the user guide for more information. (generic reference)

When referencing a sentence-case item within a sentence, set it apart with quotes, unless it’s a hyperlink.

Example: For a list of helpful links, see “Other resources.”

### Capitalizing document elements

Use title case for specific document elements, such as the following:

• Appendix A
• Chapter 2
• Example 1-1
• Figure 2-3
• Section 5.2
• Table 4

When referring to a nonspecific document element, use lowercase, for example:

• the next chapter
• the following example

### Capitalizing GUI elements

Use the same capitalization as shown in the user interface. Do not capitalize the type of item (such as pane, button, menu, dialog box, or window).

Example: Paste the URL in the Insert Hyperlink dialog box.

### Capitalizing headings and captions

For headings and captions, use sentence case—initial caps for the first word and any proper nouns.

Example: Web-based training sessions for Human Resources

### Capitalizing index entries

Use lowercase for index entries unless they are proper nouns.

See also: Indexes

### Capitalizing job titles and roles

In body text, use lowercase if the job title follows a person’s name and use title case if the job title precedes a person’s name.

Examples:

* Miguel Perez, marketing director of XYZ Inc., is the guest speaker.
* The guest speaker is Marketing Director Miguel Perez of XYZ Inc.

When the job title stands alone, such as in an email signature or on a business card, use title case for the job title.

Example:

* Miguel Perez Marketing Director XYZ Inc.

For job or project roles in a sentence, use lowercase.

Examples: project leader, sponsor, executive sponsor, program manager, lab engineer, sales specialist, business partner

### Capitalizing list items

Use sentence case for all list items, including single words and sentence fragments.

Examples:

* Uses less energy
* Reduces complexity

If you use a colon or an em dash to set off a description from a term, use sentence case for the description.

Examples:

* Personal—Anyone can change settings at this level.
* Administrative—Portal administrators can change settings at this level.

### Capitalizing product names

See: Product names

### Capitalizing proper nouns

A proper noun is the name of a particular person, place, or thing. Use title case for proper nouns wherever they occur.

Examples:

* Announcing the New Tech Con Mobile App (title using title case)
* The new Tech Con mobile app is available in the Apple and Google stores. (sentence)

Do not capitalize common nouns to add emphasis or importance.

* Correct: The webinar is for new people leaders.
* Incorrect: The webinar is for new People Leaders.

See also: Capitalization of acronyms

### Capitalizing titles

Use title case for the main title of a document and the top-level name of a website.
Do not use initial caps for the following words unless they’re the first or last word in the title:

* Articles: a, an, the
* Short conjunctions: and, as, but, if, or, nor
* Short prepositions: at, by, for, in, of, off, on, out, to, up

For hyphenated terms in a title, use initial caps for all words, except articles or short conjunctions and prepositions.

Examples: Year-End Review, On-the-Job Training

## Captions

A table caption (heading) is placed above a table. A figure (graphic) caption is placed below a figure.

## Caution text

See: Alert text

## Choose

See: Select

## Citing references

When you make a specific claim in marketing collateral—whether it’s about a Hewlett Packard Enterprise product, solution, service, or capability as a company—you must substantiate the claim with a specific reference. Do not use vague references, such as “based on HPE internal testing.”
For an internal study, include the benchmarking parameters, location, and date. For example:

* Claim: Increase performance by 90%1.
* Substantiation: 1Benchmarking and tests done with equivalent storage products in a controlled environment. HPE Labs, Palo Alto, California, January 2015.

For a report or study from an external source, such as IDC, Gartner, or Forrester, include the title, source, and publication date. For example:

* Claim: Reduce power consumption by 50%1.
* Substantiation: 1“Understanding the server landscape across medium-high performance servers.” Gartner, December 2015.

Use relevant and current citations. If a reference is more than two years old, ask the business to provide current details.

## Citing titles

See: Cross-references

## Click, press, tap

Use the term click for selecting an object on a screen such as a button or a link. Use select when there is a choice of options such as on a menu.

For specific actions, use the following terms:

* Click—Pressing and releasing a pointing device
* Press—Using keys on a keyboard (instead of push)
* Tap—Selecting an item on a touch-screen device

Do not use the word on after click, press, or tap.

* Correct: Click the Submit button.
* Incorrect: Click on the Submit button.

See also: Double-click, double-tap; Drag, drag-and-drop; Mouse; Select

## Click here, click to

Do not create links that say “here,” “click here,” or “click to [action].”
First, it’s unnecessary to tell people what to do with a link. Second, a link should be descriptive—usually specifying an action, item, or destination—and therefore easy to identify. Finally, links stand out visually in
body text, and generic “click here” text isn’t what should be highlighted. It’s especially unsightly when a paragraph contains multiple links.

* Instead of: To access the image library, click here. If you have any download issues, click here.
* Write: Access the image library. If you have any download issues, contact us.

See also: Links; URLs

## Close, open

Use the verbs close and open in reference to applications, databases, files, dialog boxes, and windows. Close is the preferred Microsoft Windows term. Use the term associated with an application if it differs from close.
Do not use shut down or terminate in place of close.

* Correct: Close the application. (Microsoft)
* Correct: Quit the application.
* Incorrect: Shut down the application.

UNIX and Linux content (and other command-line environments) might require terminology other than open and close.

## Cloud

Use lowercase for generic terms and title case for proper nouns.

Example: HPE Cloud Service Automation brokers and manages private cloud, public cloud, and traditional IT services.

## Colon
Use only one space after a colon in body text.

When to use a colon:

* To introduce a list, either in a paragraph or vertical list
  Example

  Templates are available for two applications: PowerPoint and InDesign. (Alternatively, use an em dash with no spaces.)
  Templates are available for the following applications:

  − PowerPoint
  − InDesign
* After an inline heading (such as in the following example heading)
* To introduce a command
  Example: To list all processes currently running, use the ps command: $ ps -ef
* To show a proportion or ratio
  Example: Use the 16:9 template rather than the 4:3 template.
* In video run-times (for example, 05:23)
* To refer to drives and devices, depending on the operating system (for example, the C: prompt)
When not to use a colon
* After a verb or preposition in body text

  Correct: The access levels to choose from are owner, administrator, and visitor.
  Incorrect: The access levels to choose from are: owner, administrator, and visitor.

* In place of a period at the end of a sentence that introduces an example, graphic, or table

  Correct: After completing step 3, the following screen appears.
  Incorrect: After completing step 3, the following screen appears:

## Colons with headings

Include a colon after an inline heading, but not with a stand-alone heading. For example:
Audience All team members in Sales and HR
Audience: All team members in Sales and HR

## Comma

A comma marks a pause or separates elements in a sentence. It provides the smallest interruption in continuity of thought or sentence structure.
Remember that commas are used to aid the reader. Add commas where they are needed to communicate a thought clearly.
A misplaced or omitted comma can make a sentence ambiguous or even alter the meaning.
Example
Most of the time, travelers worry about their luggage.
Most of the time travelers worry about their luggage.

### Comma, compound predicates

A compound predicate tells two or more things about a subject without repeating the subject. Do not use a comma if a compound predicate contains only two verbs.

* Correct: The speaker is engaging and has a pleasant voice.
* Incorrect: The speaker is engaging, and has a pleasant voice.

### Comma, compound sentences

A compound sentence contains two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction. The coordinating conjunctions are and, but, or, nor, for, so, and yet.
Use a comma before the conjunction unless the clauses are short and closely related.

Examples:

* Save the file and close the program.
* The main menu displays five options, and the submenus provide selections for those options.

See also: Conjunctions

### Comma, conditional clauses

Use a comma after a conditional clause at the beginning of a sentence.

* Correct: If the issue persists, restart your computer.
* Incorrect: If the issue persists restart your computer.

### Comma, contrasting and interrupting expressions

To set off a contrasting or interrupting expression, use one or more commas depending on the sentence structure.

Examples:

The service event involved software, not hardware.
Loosen, but do not remove, the seven retaining screws.

### Comma, coordinate adjectives (independent modifiers)

Coordinate adjectives separately modify the noun that follows. Because they’re independent, they can be listed in any order. Use a comma between coordinate adjectives.

Examples:

* The case has a smooth, glossy finish.
* The case has a glossy, smooth finish.

When in doubt, consider whether the word and could be used in place of the comma. If it could, the comma is correct.

### Comma, cumulative adjectives (unit modifiers)

Cumulative adjectives are two or more adjectives that build on one another and together modify a noun. Their order cannot be changed without changing the meaning.

If the word and could not be used between the adjectives, do not use commas.

* Example: The case has a metallic navy blue finish.

### Comma, introductory and transitional expressions

Use a comma after an introductory or transitional expression at the beginning of a sentence.

Examples:

* To replace the system board, see the instructions in the service guide.
* As a result, the memory devices have a longer time to decode memory cycles.
* Use commas to set off transitional words or phrases in the middle of a sentence.

Example: This three-year warranty, however, does not apply to the monitor.

When a transitional word joins two complete clauses, use a semicolon before the word and a comma after it. Alternatively, divide the clauses into two sentences.

Example:

* The URLs will change next month; therefore, you’ll need to update your links.
* The URLs will change next month. Therefore, you’ll need to update your links.

Table 2: Common transitional words and phrases

• Also
• As a result
• Consequently
• For example
• However
• In addition
• In conclusion
• In fact
• In general
• In the meantime
• Instead
• Likewise
• Moreover
• Next
• Nevertheless
• Of course
• Therefore
• To summarize

### Comma, names and job titles

When a person’s title follows their name, use a comma between the name and title.

Example: The scheduled speaker is Jean Smith, chief technology officer.

See also: Capitalizing job titles and roles

### Comma, names with a suffix

When a person’s name has a suffix, do not include a comma unless the name is listed with the last name first.

Examples:

```
Joe C. Smith Jr.
Joe C. Smith III
Smith, Joe C., Jr.
Smith, Joe C., III
```

### Comma, nonrestrictive appositives

An appositive is a noun or noun phrase that renames or further describes another noun beside it. A nonrestrictive appositive does not contain essential information.
Use commas to set off nonrestrictive appositives.

Examples:

The first board, the disk controller, supports up to six separate hard drives.
For more information about options, see Chapter 5, “Expanding your system.”
Nonrestrictive appositives are sometimes introduced by the word or.

Example: Such semaphores are often called mutual exclusion semaphores, or mutexes.

### Comma, numbers

HPE follows the common style of using commas with numbers 10,000 and above. A comma is not used for 1000 through 9000.

### Comma, place names

Use a comma to separate a city from a state.
Example: HPE has a campus in Houston, Texas.
If a city, state, or country construction appears at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence, use a comma after the state or country.
Example: Erskine, Scotland, is the site of the main European manufacturing plant.

### Comma, preventing misinterpretation

Use commas where needed to prevent misinterpretation.

Correct: X replaces A, and B and C are added together.
Incorrect: X replaces A and B and C are added together.
Sometimes, the better alternative is to rewrite the sentence.

### Comma, quotation marks

Place a comma inside the closing quotation mark unless the quotation marks are part of a literal string.

Examples

An error message, “Invalid User,” is displayed when access is denied.
The symbol can have one of the following values: ABST, “ABST”, or %ABST.

### Comma, restrictive and nonrestrictive elements

Restrictive modifiers and clauses are essential to the meaning of the sentence; without them, the meaning would be different. They are often introduced with that (not which). Commas are not used with restrictive elements.
Nonrestrictive modifiers and clauses supply additional information; without them, although there would be less information, the basic meaning would be the same. They are often introduced with which (not that). Commas are used with nonrestrictive elements.

Examples:

A presentation that has 50 slides cannot be delivered in an hour. (restrictive)
His presentation, which he worked on all week, has 50 slides. (nonrestrictive)
See also: That, which

### Comma, series

Place a comma before the conjunction (usually and or or) in a series of three or more items. Commonly known as the serial comma or the Oxford comma, it adds clarity and consistency.

Examples:

You’ll find templates, job aids, and other resources to guide you.

The information can be submitted in Word, PowerPoint, or Excel.

If any item in a series has internal commas, use semicolons to separate the items.

Example: See Table 3-1 for steps 1, 2, and 3; Table 3-2 for the parts list; and Table 3-3 for commands.

## Commands

Use the following guidelines for commands in body text and titles:

* Use the verb enter rather than type when introducing a command.
* Use command names only as nouns or adjectives. Do not use command names as verbs.
* Retain the case for all case-sensitive commands, unless used within a title.
* Do not begin a sentence with the name of a command if the name begins with a lowercase letter.
* Set a command apart using a constant-width font or bold text.

Example: Enter the lpr command.

* Place long commands on a separate line. Do not add a period at the end of the command.

Example:

* Enter the following command: vgexport –s –p -m /tmp/vg_shared.map vg_shared

When writing about UNIX and Linux systems and applications, follow the appropriate conventions for the user community:

− Use the verb launch to describe a persistent application.
− Use the verb execute for commands that return immediately to the command line.

See also: Close, open; Arrow symbol

## Compared to, compared with

Use compared to when describing a similarity between things.

Example: She compared leading the project to walking through quicksand.

Use compared with when contrasting similarities and differences.

Example: He compared HPE Helion with our competitors’ cloud technology.

## Compose, comprise

Compose means to make up. Comprise means to be made up of. Do not use the phrase comprised of.

The parts compose the whole; the whole comprises the parts; the whole is composed of the parts.

## Conciseness

See: Wordiness

## Confidentiality

Internal Use Only, Confidential, and Private are the labels used to mark internal-only data. For more information, see Guidelines for Labeling Information Assets.

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions are words that join two or more words, phrases, or clauses.

In conversational writing, it’s acceptable to start a sentence with a coordinating conjunction: and, but, for, nor, or, yet. This helps to create shorter sentences, which aids online reading, and gives readers a pause between two points.

Example: The day is about cultivating the spirit of giving throughout the year. And it’s about celebrating our incredible reach as a global team.

## Conjunctions, ambiguous

Do not use conjunctions such as and and or ambiguously, which can cause misinterpretation.

Example: You can respond to the message by entering EXIT, which causes an error condition, and a branch to the EOF label specified in the ACCEPT statement.
Possible misinterpretation: You can respond to the message both by entering EXIT, which causes an EOF error condition, and by branching to the EOF label specified in the ACCEPT statement.

Intended meaning: You can respond to the message by entering EXIT, which causes an EOF error condition. The EOF error condition causes a branch to the EOF label if one is specified in the ACCEPT statement.

## Consistency of terms

Use consistent terminology. Always refer to the same object with the same term. For example, do not write system reset in one part of a document and warm boot in another.

## Continual, continuous

Continual means repeated at frequent intervals. Continuous means uninterrupted.

## Contractions

Contractions are informal and conversational. Use contractions only where informality is acceptable, such as in communications and marketing material.

Example: Here’s an exciting opportunity for everyone who’s interested in stretch assignments.

Although HPE Brand Marketing encourages informal language, it’s important to consider your audience and subject matter.

In technical documentation, contractions are acceptable only in a direct quote and in the commonly used heading “What’s new.” Do not use contractions in formal writing such as legal documents and proposals.

See also: Writing tone

## Cross-references

Cross-references are useful only when they point to relevant material. Always indicate the nature of the material being referenced.
Use see instead of refer to. In a sentence, begin with a description of what can be found at the referenced location. A short sentence, however, may begin with see.

Examples:

For descriptions of the configurable jumpers, see Chapter 4, “System board jumpers.”
See the QuickSpecs for details.

###  Cross-references to other documents

When cross-referencing other documents, capitalize the title as it appears in the referenced document. Include the document part number if one is available. Put the title in italics.

Example: For more information, see the HPE ProLiant MicroServer Reference Guide.

Before linking to an online document, consider the life cycle of the document and stability of the webpage.

When referring to a document generically, use lowercase.

Example: See the user guide that came with your product.

For references to specific content in other documents, use only the document title. Do not include a chapter or page number, section title, or heading since these often change from one version to the next.

###Cross-references within a document

For references to text in the same document:
• If the chapters and sections are numbered, make cross-references by chapter, section number, or appendix letter.
Example: For more information on storage options, see Chapter 3.
• If the chapters and sections are not numbered, make cross-references by giving the title in quotation marks.
Example: See “Storage options.”
• Do not include page numbers in a cross-reference if this is not done automatically by your application.
• Avoid the words above, below, earlier, or later as pointers to information. Be specific when referencing another chapter, section, graphic, table, or appendix.
• Include an index entry for the topic so users can find the information.

### Cross-references in glossaries
Use See if you are not supplying a definition for the current entry and you are referring the reader to another term that is similar to the one you are defining.

Example: See disk cache, cache memory

Use See to refer from an acronym to the spelled-out form or from the spelled-out form to the acronym.

Example: Certified Systems Engineer. See CSE

Use See also if you are supplying a definition in the entry and you also want the reader to refer to another glossary entry.

Example: Timesharing. A method of allocating computer time in which each process gets an equal amount of time in turn. See also real-time processing

### Cross-references in indexes

Use see when referring the reader to another term in the index.

Example: memory modules. See DIMMs

Use see to cross-reference a synonym.

Example: thumb drive. See flash drive

Use see also to refer to a related index entry.

Example: error codes, 14. See also error messages

## Ctrl-x, Ctrl+x

See: Keys pressed simultaneously

## Currency
Use numerals with a symbol for currency, whether isolated or in a sentence.

Examples: $250, £500, €200

For thousands, use all numerals or abbreviate thousand with an uppercase K. Do not insert a space between the numeral and the abbreviation.

Examples: $350,000, $350K

For millions and above, use a mixture of numerals and spelled-out or abbreviated numbers.

Examples: $3 million, $3M

For the dollar monetary unit, include the country abbreviation for non-US currency.

Examples: CAD$500, Mex$6000, NZ$600

For standard codes for international currencies, see the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 4217).

## Cyber terms
The most common cyber terms are one word.

Examples: cybercafé, cybercrime, cybersecurity, cyberspace

When in doubt about a cyber term, consult the Merriam-Webster dictionary. If a term isn’t in the dictionary as one word, write it with a hyphen.

Examples: cyber-activity, cyber-attack, cyber-threat

When a cyber term is part of a proper noun, write it however it appears in the name.

Example: Read more on our Cyber Security website.

## Danger alert

See: Alert text

## Dashes

The two types of dashes are the em dash (—), which is the long one, and the en dash (–), which is the short one.

### Em dash

Use em dashes—without a space before or after—in the following instances:

• To provide a longer pause than a comma indicates

Example: Review the examples for voice and style—not for technical accuracy.

• To set apart a phrase from surrounding text for clarity

Example: We added two paid holidays—a company holiday and a floating holiday of your choosing—for 13 total per year.

• To separate a list item from its run-in discussion as an alternative to using colons

Example

The table includes the following columns:
− Status—Displays icons that show if a migration succeeded or failed
− Time—Lists the date and time of the migration step

When en dashes are used for bullets, consider using colons instead of em dashes to separate the text.

Example

The table includes the following columns:
− Status: Displays icons that show if a migration succeeded or failed
− Time: Lists the date and time of the migration step

### En dash

Use an en dash in the following instances:

• In a range of numbers
Example: 10–20 characters
• In a negative number
Example: –30°C
• As a subtraction (minus) sign with a space before and after the dash

Example: °C = (°F – 32) x 5/9

Do not use a dash when presenting code or command lines. Use a hyphen so the user can copy and paste the code or command.

See also: Hyphen; Numbers, ranges

## Data, datum

Use the term data for both singular and plural forms with the singular verb form. Do not use datum.

Example: The data collected from the surveys is combined.

## Data center

Write data center as two words, except when it appears as one word in a product or service name.

Example: The data center is closing in November.

Exception example: HPE Datacenter Care

## Dates

For all audiences, use the Month Day Year format.
Example: May 1, 2021

## Day

In a date, the day is read as an ordinal number, but it is written as a cardinal number.

Correct: June 11, 2021
Incorrect: June 11th, 2021

NOTE: An ordinal number would only be used with the word day (for example, the 11th day of June) or if the month is excluded (for example, on Monday, the 11th).

## Month and year
When writing the month and year without the day, do not use a comma. In a date, a comma is used only to distinguish between two sets of numerals.

Correct: July 2021
Incorrect: July, 2021

Always use four digits for the year. If the year is obvious, it can be omitted in most instances.

Example: Join us this Friday, December 15, to celebrate.

For month abbreviations, use three characters and no period: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec.
Date ranges
Use an en dash to indicate a range of dates. If the range is within the same month, do not include spaces with the dash. If the range spans different months, include a space before and after the dash.
Examples: August 5–6; January 8 – February 12
Dates within a sentence
When writing the full date within a sentence, include a comma after the year.
Example: The event will be on March 3, 2021, in Madrid.
When writing the month and year only, do not include a comma unless the date is in an introductory clause.
Examples
The event will be held in March 2021 at the new site.
In March 2021, the event will be held at the new site.
To ensure that the day and month stay together on the same line, insert a nonbreaking space between them.
Writing Style Guide
HPE INTERNAL USE ONLY 46
Numeric dates
Do not use numeric dates for a global audience. Spelling out the month avoids misinterpretation.
Numeric dates are acceptable when writing informally for a US audience.
Example: 10/1/2020
In a list, you might want to use precede one-digit months and days with a zero to keep them uniform.
Example
04/07/2020 09/25/2020 12/01/2020
Degrees of an angle
Use the degree symbol (°) to refer to degrees of an angle.
Correct: Pulling out the feet on the keyboard base angles the keyboard an extra 15°.
Incorrect: Pulling out the feet on the keyboard base angles the keyboard an extra 15 degrees.
Degrees of temperature
Use the degree symbol (°) in a specific temperature, for example: 25°C (68°F). Do not insert a space between the numeral and the degree symbol.
Do not use the symbol without a numeral.
Correct: The temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius.
Incorrect: The temperatures are measured in °C.
Detail, amount of
Focus on including need-to-know information rather than nice-to-know information.
For example, if your objective is to explain how to install a memory board, do not provide a functional description of the board. Instead, give the installation instructions and include helpful details.
The following example lacks helpful detail:
Example: Locate option slot 2 on the left side of the system unit.
Adding the statement, “Positioning yourself in front of the system unit,” immediately orients the reader:
Example: Positioning yourself in front of the system unit, locate option slot 2 on the left side of the system unit.
Dialog box
Identify a dialog box as such on the first usage. In subsequent references, you may drop the term dialog box.
Example
In the Word Options dialog box, select Display. (first)
In Word Options, select Customize Ribbon. (subsequent)
Dialog, dialogue
Use dialog only in the term dialog box, which refers to communication between a user and a system.
Writing Style Guide
HPE INTERNAL USE ONLY 47
Use dialogue in reference to a conversation between people or between entities representing people (for example, a dialogue between two companies).
Displays
The verb displays is a transitive verb and requires an object.
Correct: The application displays the confirmation message.
Incorrect: The confirmation message displays.
Use the verb form is displayed to describe the invocation of a window or dialog box. Alternatively, use the word appears, which would put the statement in the active voice.
Example
The Open Style dialog box is displayed.
The Open Style dialog box appears.
See also: Active voice; Appears
Double-click, double-tap
Use the term double-click to describe quickly pressing and releasing a mouse button twice without moving the mouse. Use the term double-tap to describe tapping a touch screen twice to select an item.
See also: Click, press, tap
Drag, drag-and-drop
Use the term drag to describe moving an object across a computer screen using a tool such as a mouse.
Example: Drag the folder to the desktop.
Use drag-and-drop as an adjective, not as a verb.
Example: You can add a file as an attachment to a message by using a drag-and-drop operation.
Do not write press and hold or click and drag.
See also: Click, press, tap
Drop-down, pull-down
The term drop-down is used as an adjective only, never a noun. The term is always hyphenated.
Example: Select your printer from the drop-down list.
Do not use the term pull-down.
Due to, because of, since
See: Because of, due to, since
e-terms
Write email without a hyphen. For other e-terms, use a lowercase e and a hyphen, even when used in a title, unless a product or program name uses a different style.
Examples: e-business, e-commerce, e-Business Continues to Grow (title)
Avoid styling generic e-terms with a lowercase e followed by a capital letter (for example, eBusiness).
Writing Style Guide
HPE INTERNAL USE ONLY 48
Avoid using an e-term at the beginning of a sentence.
Either/or, neither/nor
When you list two alternatives in a format that includes or, you can insert either at the beginning of the list so the reader knows to expect an alternative.
Example: Copy the file either to a different folder or to an encrypted USB drive.
Follow the same format if you are using the neither/nor format.
Example: Neither file A nor file B should be removed from the SharePoint site.
Use either/or and neither/nor only to specify two options.
Correct: Either a or b
Incorrect: Either a or b or c
To avoid having to rewrite the sentence if the number of alternatives changes, avoid either/or and neither/nor constructions.
Ellipsis
Do not use an ellipsis (…) to indicate a pause unless you are writing a script. Use ellipses in a code example, in a number series, or in a quote to represent an omission.
See also: Ellipsis in a series of numbers
Elusive, illusive
Elusive means not easily grasped or defined. Illusive means imaginary.
Emphasis (highlighting)
The styles approved by the Global Brand team for emphasizing text are italics and bold. Choose either style, not both, for the same text
Examples
Back up your hard drive before beginning the next operation.
After deleting the partition, you cannot recover the data it contained.
Use emphasis sparingly, or it will lose its effect.
All caps should not be used to emphasize words within a sentence, which can be interpreted as “shouting.”
Avoid emphasizing words like no, not, always, must, and never (see also: Absolute terms).
Italics
Use italicized text in these instances:
• When referring to a book or document by its complete title
• To indicate a replaceable path or term in a command
Example: Execute http://hostname.domain:8088/login.htm
• To identify a letter as a letter and a word as a word
Writing Style Guide
HPE INTERNAL USE ONLY 49
Example: Use a lowercase p to abbreviate the word page.
Bold
Use bold text in these instances:
• For strong emphasis of a word or phrase
• For actions in a procedure (for example, click OK)
• To differentiate listed items from their description (optional)
Employees, team members
In most cases, refer to HPE employees as team members. The term employee is used where legally required or recommended, most notably within HR.
See also: Managers, people leaders
End notes
Avoid using end notes. Use footnotes instead.
End user, end-user
Use end user as a noun and end-user as an adjective.
Examples
End users are responsible for registering their products. (noun)
Product registration is an end-user responsibility. (adjective)
In most cases, the shorter term user is a better choice.
Ensure, insure, assure
Ensure means to guarantee, or to make certain.
Example: To ensure the highest quality, schedule weekly inspections.
Instead of using ensure to mean make certain, use be sure or make sure to aid in translation.
Examples
Be sure to record the serial number.
Make sure that you have your passport.
Insure means to cover with insurance.
Example: You should insure your property against theft.
Assure means to convince someone of something.
Example: I assure you that we will meet the deadline.
IMPORTANT: In some contexts, assure or ensure could establish a guarantee or be legally binding, so use these terms carefully.

## Enter

Use enter to instruct users to perform the following actions:

Issue commands from the keyboard.

* Example: Enter the command to restart your computer.

Insert text into fields or on the command line.

* Example: Enter your password at the password prompt.

## Examples

Good examples are an effective way to illustrate or reinforce information. Follow these guidelines when writing examples:

* Create examples that are simple and straightforward.
* Avoid illustrating multiple points in one example when several examples would be more effective.
* Describe any restrictions or exceptions to what the example is illustrating.
* Avoid using culture-specific references. Never refer to national, racial, religious, sexist, or other stereotypes in examples.
* Use fictional names, addresses, and phone numbers. In North America, the phone numbers 555-0100 through 555-0199 are reserved for fictional references to phone numbers.

## Exclamation point

Do not use an exclamation point as end punctuation in technical writing.
In other types of writing, use exclamation points sparingly. Avoid two exclamatory statements in a row, and never use double exclamation points.

## Farther, further

Farther refers to physical distance. Further means additional, continued, or to a greater degree.

## Fewer, less

See: Less, fewer

## Figures

See: Graphics

## Fiscal reference

When referring to the fiscal year, the preferred format is FY16. When including the quarter, the preferred format is Q3 FY16. For a reference to a fiscal year half, the preferred format is 1H FY16.
