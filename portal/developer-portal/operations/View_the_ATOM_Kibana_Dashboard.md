    View the ATOM Dashboard to select a time range to see ATOM errors for Shasta system nodes.

3.  Choose the time range of interest.

4.  View any nodes marked **admindown** and any ATOM test failures. These failures occur during health checks and application test failures. Test failures marked **admindown** are important to note. View the matching log messages in the panel\(s\) on the right, and view the counts of each message per NID in the panel\(s\) on the left. If desired, results can be filtered by NID by clicking the icon showing a **+** inside a magnifying glass next to each NID.
