# Kernel Kibana Dashboard

The Kernel Dashboard displays compute node failures such as kernel assertions, kernel panics, and Lustre LBUG messages. The messages reveal if Lustre has experienced a fatal error on any compute nodes in the system. A CPU stall is a serious problem that might result in a node failure. Out-of-memory conditions can be due to applications or system problems and may require expert analysis. They provide useful clues for some node failures and may reveal if an application is using too much memory.
