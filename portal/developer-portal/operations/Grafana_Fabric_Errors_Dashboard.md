# Grafana Fabric Errors Dashboard

![](images/Grafana_HSN_Errors.png)

This dashboard reports error counters in a tabular format in three panels.

There is no **Interval** option because this parameter is not used to set a coarseness of the data. Only a single value is presented that displays the most recent value in the time range.

Unlike other dashboards, the locations presented are all locations in the system rather than having telemetry within the time range selected. However, the values are taken from telemetry within the time range.
