# Grafana Fabric RFC3635 Dashboard

For additional information on performance counters, refer to, [Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3635), an Internet standards document.

Because these metrics are counters that only increase over time, the values plotted are the change in the counter's value over the interval setting.
