## Remove obsolete configuration file sections

### Prerequisites

- The [Install the System Admin Toolkit Product Stream](#install-the-system-admin-toolkit-product-stream)
    procedure has been successfully completed.
- The [Perform NCN Personalization](#perform-ncn-personalization) procedure has been successfully completed.

### Procedure

After upgrading SAT, if using the configuration file from a previous version, there may be
configuration file sections no longer used in the new version. For example, when upgrading
from Shasta 1.4 to Shasta 1.5, the `[redfish]` configuration file section is no longer used.
In that case, the following warning may appear upon running `sat` commands.

```screen
WARNING: Ignoring unknown section 'redfish' in config file.
```

Remove the `[redfish]` section from `/root/.config/sat/sat.toml` to resolve the warning.

```screen
[redfish]
username = "admin"
password = "adminpass"
```

Repeat this process for any configuration file sections for which there are "unknown section" warnings.
