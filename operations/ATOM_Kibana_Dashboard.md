# ATOM Kibana Dashboard

The ATOM \(Application Task Orchestration and Management\) Dashboard displays node failures that occur during health checks and application test failures. Some test failures are of *possible* interest even though a node is not marked **admindown** or otherwise fails. They are of *clear* interest if a node is marked **admindown**, and might provide clues if a node otherwise fails. They might also show application problems.
