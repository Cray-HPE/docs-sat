# Navigate SAT Grafana Dashboards

There are four Fabric Telemetry dashboards used in SAT that report on the HSN. Two contain chart panels and two display telemetry in a tabular format.

|Dashboard Name|Display Type|
|--------------|------------|
|Fabric Congestion|Chart Panels|
|Fabric RFC3635|Chart Panels|
|Fabric Errors|Tabular Format|
|Fabric Port State|Tabular Format|

The tabular format presents a single point of telemetry for a given location and metric, either because the telemetry is not numerical or that it changes infrequently. The value shown is the most recently reported value for that location during the time range selected, if any. The interval setting is not used for tabular dashboards.
